# [free-for.dev](https://free-for.dev)

Developers and Open Source authors have access to many services with free tiers but still have to go through traditional buying processes when you want to actually pay for a product.

This is a list of software (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, etc.) and other offerings that offer deals specifically for developers.

The scope of this particular list is similar to that of [free-for.dev](https://github.com/ripienaar/free-for-dev) where it is limited to things that infrastructure developers (System Administrator, DevOps Practitioners, etc.) are likely to find useful.

If you are a software developer and would like to add a deal to the list, you can by by sending [Pull Requests](https://github.com/deals-for-dev/deals) to add more deals.

*NOTE:* This list is only for as-a-Service offerings, not for self-hosted software. For a service to be eligible it has to offer a deal for developers.  Deals that are offered to all customers will be considered but we will likely reject offers that are generic or publicly available.
